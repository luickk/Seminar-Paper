# Seminar-Paper (Seminararbeit)

This is my seminar paper which is a scientific paper that is required to be written by the attendants for the final exam (the Abitur). 
The paper is written in LaTeX and focuses on the Schr√∂dinger equation, how it's derived and it's meaning for higher quantum physic theories.
